# Splitting into Two Tracks

Final projects are coming along, and as some of us start to finish them, I see two major groups:

One group is bored by just presenting information, and would like to dive deeper into writing code and more technical challenges.

The other group is fine with the level of technical challenge, but would like to explore tools for making the sites have a better aesthetics.

I think I know what group each of you wants, but really it is up to you.

## Requirements

To move on to one of these tracks, you must do all of the following:

* Be ready to answer the questions for the ending assessment. Can you remember what some of those questions were? We will review them tomorrow
* Complete a webpage with at least four pages including the front page. It should have a style that you have created and each page should have at least one screen full of content you have collected, researched, or made. Nobody should have to use the back button to navigate your site.
* Your site should be tested by three students, Mr. M, and Mr. G. You should address any constructive criticism that they bring with changes to your css or content.

## Tonight

Tonight you can express to me your interest in one of these two tracks by doing one of the following

### Design Track

Go to either the [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) websites and try for 30 minutes to figure out what these tools are. Bonus points if you implement one of them on a page that you have. Write one paragraph describing what you think these are for and how they can help you.

### Javascript Track

Read the [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) Introduction through 'Functions'. If you finish that before 1 hour, try to see how far you can get on the [Codecademy](codecademy.com) JavaScript track. Write one paragraph explaining what a function is, and what a loop is.

## Conclusion

Have fun! See you tomorrow.
