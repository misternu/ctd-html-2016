# Basic Tag Challenge

In one hour, correctly use as many of these tags as you can in a new CodePen, using no css or styling. You can be creative, or just do a minimal demonstration if you want. Include text in your pen describing what each element type does. You haven't been taught most of these by me. When possible, try them out first, then look up as much information as you want from the [MDN](http://developer.mozilla.com). When you run out of time, click save, submit what you have and STOP until the morning in class. If you wish, you may restart your timer so that it actually started...NOW.

### `<h1>` through `<h6>` Headings

Use all 6 sizes. Be sure to take notes in your pen about what font size each of these is by default.

### `<p>` Paragraph

Make two or three paragraphs in a row. If you need filler text, and you don't want to type, use text from [this website](http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html).

Do you like the way that these paragraphs are separated? What if every site was just like this, would that be good?

### `<i>` Italic & `<b>` Bold

Try these out in one of your paragraphs from before.

### `<a>` Anchor

Uh oh! I probably haven't demonstrated this to you yet! Can you figure out how to work it from the documentation alone? We will be learning a lot more about it very soon. Make it so that it sends me to `http://www.youtube.com/`

### `<ul>` & `<li>` Unordered List & List Item

Do you think better or the same as just typing out bullet points? I think it's better, can you guess why? There is no wrong answer.

### `<blockquote>`  Blockquote

Put one of your favorite quotes between your example paragraphs from earlier

### `<hr>`  Horizontal Rule

We are only going to use this one once so that you never, ever, ever, ever, ever use it again. Put it below your other content. Say "Copyright [your name] 2016" in a `p` tag underneath. This used to be really popular for some reason.

### `<img>` Image

Go on google images and find your favorite picture of an adolescent mammal. Can you make it appear somewhere in your pen? Remember, for help you can check the [MDN](http://developer.mozilla.com). Does the image look like it is the right size in comparison to the rest of the text?

### `<div>` Division

Try putting this pair of tags around various things (`<div>stuff</div>`). Like a paragraph, or only part of a paragraph. Huh, that's weird. Wait, what did it do? If you had to describe what a div is in two words, what would those two words be?

### Conclusion

If you made it to the conclusion before the time was up, I have my work cut out for me.
