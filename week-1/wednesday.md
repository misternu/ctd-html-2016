# Tuesday

## Morning (8:30am - 11:00am)

### Complete CYOA Challenge

I forgot to post the link into schoology, so many of you couldn't find the homework. We will continue and finish this challenge today, as it is a valuable concept for us to use in our websites.

### Webpage Template

We seem to be making these basic files a lot. What if we had some sort of template that we could use every time? Let's make a copy of our html boiler plate, an empty `style.css` file, and an empty images folder. When we are starting a new challenge, we can just copy from these files.

### Audio tags, YouTube embed

Demonstration, followed by students submitting their own examples

### Planning packet on schoology

We need to think about some basic questions about who our site is for, why we are making it, and what kind of results we aim to achieve. Type your responses into text files, and save our results to your project folders

## Afternoon (Noon - 2:45pm)

### Pack up at or before 2:30pm

Check to see if anyone needs to do a bathroom break.
