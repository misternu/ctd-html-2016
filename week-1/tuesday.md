# Tuesday

## Morning (8:30am - 11:00am)

### Review of basic tags challenge

Stand up meeting up front to discuss the problems that people might have had. Live coding to show how all of the tags work. Students return to stations to edit their submissions given this new information. Get teacher approval on all submissions before moving on.

### Local file challenge

Demonstrate how to download and include image files with your html files. Show them the difference between local and remote linking.

### Photoshop

See what we can learn about how to use photoshop. If possible, we should include transparency in these images. Once we have all made something, practice exporting images. Take those images and link them in our previous local files.

Demonstrate wireframing. Set standards for what will be in this wireframe. Now the students should try to create their own standard wireframes. Once the submissions are in, discuss the pros/cons of planning your website.

## Afternoon (Noon - 2:45pm)

### Planning packet on schoology

We need to think about some basic questions about who our site is for, why we are making it, and what kind of results we aim to achieve. Save our results to the desktop.

### Work out the details of how we are going to be able to save our work

We need to have a folder on the shared drive to hold the students work. It will have subfolders for each project. Once made, we should move our planning information and our first wireframe into those folders.

###

### Pack up at or before 2:30pm

Yesterday we were late to leave! We will fix it this time. Check to see if anyone needs to do a bathroom break.
