# Friday

We have gotten way ahead of schedule, and today, we are going to try to explore CSS positioning.

### Chrome Dev Tools Demo

This is going to be our best tool for exploring positioning, because it will always give us instant feedback. We will play together with the idea of moving elements around the page.

We will spend some time trying to create some examples of our own, for sharing with the class

### Choosing a color scheme

Taking into account our answers to the planning questions, we should generate some color schemes for our websites.

### One on One

One on one meetings to talk about progress with the material and with planning our websites.
