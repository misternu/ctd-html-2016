# Monday

## Morning (8:30am - 11:00am)

### Introductions

Lets get to know each other.

### Class Behavior and Expectations

* What are the rules this summer?
* The basic idea of pair programming
* How to deal with varying skill levels

### Review what our plan is for the course

We will go over the syllabus and answer any questions that you might have about how the course is going to go.

### Preliminary Assessment

This is the same assessment that we will be taking at the end of the course. It will demonstrate that we have progressed in our understanding in addition to producing a product.

### Internet Citizenship

How should we behave on the internet? What should we be careful of, is the internet dangerous? How should we treat content from the internet that other people have produced?

### CodePen Demo

If we have time before lunch, I will pull up CodePen and demonstrate some of what we will be learning about.

## Afternoon (Noon - 2:45pm)

### Login Check

Lets make sure everyone who can have a CodePen account has one. Once that is done, lets get everyone on a Schoology account as well.

### Hello World Challenge

Now that we are on Schoology, you should be able to have access to our first challenge. This is mostly a test so that we can be sure that everything is working, and so you know what the routine will be for challenges.

### Discussion about Failure

What does it mean to fail at something? Is it a bad thing? How does failure usually feel? How do you think it should make you feel?

### A short history of the Internet

How did the internet get here? What did it start as? What has it become?

### Choose topics for websites

We can use the rest of the day to start brainstorming and researching our website topics. It may be necessary to scale back more ambitious projects that you have in mind, or to expand your idea to something bigger.
