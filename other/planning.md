# Planning Exercise

It is time to start planning our final project websites. There are three main questions to answer. Open Notepad++ and start a new text file. There are three main questions that we need to answer. Use 2-3 sentences on each.

### What is the Reason for your website?

Not just a reason for you to want to make it. Indepenent of you, what circumstances in the world make you think that this site needs to be made?

### What Results do you expect your website will create?

What impact will it have on the world? Importantly, what effect will your site have on the issue described in your answer to the first question? It's okay if the impact isn't large, but you should still be able to describe it.

### Who is the target audience for your website?

What age groups? Is the site only in english, or in many languages? Do they share a hobby with you, or can anyone use it? Will they visit just once, or will they return frequently? How long do your users want to spend on your site during each visit?
