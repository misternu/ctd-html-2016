# Tuesday

## Website Projects

Continue working on your websites. Feel free to ask me for help, but also try to look it up first in the MDN. You are also free to help each other with sites.

### Code Review

We may do some live coding and demonstrations of people's sites. This will allow you to see each others progress and to learn from each others ideas.

### Navbar Demo

We have all been having issues with navbars, time for a quick demonstration of the basics.

## Afternoon

### jQuery Demo

I'll show you a bit of jQuery. It's much easier than JavaScript, but don't worry if it doesn't make sense the first time.

### Stretch CSS Challenge

Todays stretch challenge will be the 'hover' pseudoclass.
