# Thursday

### Demos to class

Some of your sites are really coming along. Throughout the day, I will call some of you up to demo your project as it currently is and to share tips for getting it done.

### User Testing

When you feel like your site is ready for it, we are going to do user testing using your classmates. You will have multiple classmates use your sites and give constructive criticism.

### Javascript and Bootstrap Demos

After lunch, I will call up the two branches to watch demos on the basics of what we will be getting done in the advanced material.
